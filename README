Will create a new board, then try to place a piece on it. (3,1) is empty on the startign board layout.

b = CheckersBoard.new
p = Piece.new(:red, b, [3,1])
b.add_piece(p, [3,1])
b[[3,1]].valid_slides([3,1])

b[[1,1]].color
b[[2,2]].valid_slides([2,2])
b.add_piece(p,[3,3])
b[[2,2]].valid_jumps([2,2])

p = Piece.new(:white, b, [4,2])
b.add_piece(p, [4,2])
